# Rotating compass for your 3D Unity project
Pretty simple rotating compass with degreeses 


1. First, you need to download and add these 2 files to your scripts folder,
2. After, change the texture type of CompassUI to "sprite (2D and UI)"
3. Create a new empty object, and in that empty object create a new Canvas, then in a new canvas create a new text (UI > Legacy > Text) and after add a compass image to the canvas, place it as you like, in my case it looks like that -
