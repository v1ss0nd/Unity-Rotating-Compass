# Rotating compass for your 3D Unity project
A pretty simple on-screen rotating compass, with text degreeses 

## How to use it:
1. First, you need to download and put these 2 files into your scripts folder
2. After, you must to change the texture type of the "CompassUI" to "sprite (2D and UI)"
3. Now, Create a new empty object, and in the new empty object create a new Canvas, then in the new created canvas, create a new text (UI > Legacy > Text), then add a compass image to the canvas, place it as you like, in my case it looks like that -
